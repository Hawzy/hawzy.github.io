For Day 17 I'm going to setup a Golang environment on my Windows 10 PC.

Going to be following along this guide on Youtube: [Golang Beginners Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8Jx3f01igA)

## Install

Head over to the Golang download section and grab your correct installer [golang downloads](https://go.dev/dl/).  

In VSCode open extensions and install the Rich Go language support plugin.

setup a new project directory 'mkdir C:\github\golang'
