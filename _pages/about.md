Hi, my name is Nick.  I live in Washington State with my wife and 2 daughters.  I'm starting this blog as part of my New Years resolution for growth and I'm going to use this platform to:

* 100 Days of Code [non-consecutive :)]
* Explore some new technologies
* Document personal projects
* Learn some stuff
* Share what I learn

I've been working as a Security Engineer for the last 4 years and prior to that I worked in Windows Systems Ops/Administration for 12 years. 

My hobbies include board gaming, golf, PC gaming, fantasy football, gambling, and general tech stuff.  So expect to see more content related to that on this blog eventually.
